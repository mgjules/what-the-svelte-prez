## What the Svelte?

<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">Probably the </span><span style="color: #FF3E00" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">hottest</span><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"> question right now!</span>

notes:
- You know why it's the hottest question right now?
- Because I just said the question and you're all thinking about it right now!
- Which makes it by definition, the hottest question right now!



## But first off!

Who are we? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Probably the hot.. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> 
<code style="font-size: 0.6em;color:yellow;" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">console.log("here");</code>

notes: 
- There's front-end people here.. back-end.. middle-end.. mobile/native/hybrid.. etc [next]
- But at the end of the day, we know we are software engineers. But what does that mean? [next]
- That's what you get for preparing slides at the last minute



## Software Engineer

<span style="font-size: 0.7em" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">TODO: [ insert epic quote image here ]</span>

<span style="font-size: 0.6em; color: red" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">I failed!!</span>

notes:
- Anyone got an idea? Not a trick question!
- I spent the whole night looking for a quote I saw in a youtube video a while back [next]
- I Failed!
- But the main the gist of the quote is that as Software Engineers, we get paid primarily to get data from point A to point B.
- We collect, analyze, transform, move, store data for the whole purpose of monetizing it.

# Svelte 

Another JS framework!!! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

<img src="/img/annoyed.gif" /> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

notes: 
Show of hand:
- Anyone heard of Svelte?? 
- Svelte is a JavaScript framework! ... I'll let that sink in! [next]
- Yup.. like we did not need anymore of those, right? [next]
- And that's how you probably are feeling inside! Because, that's how I FELT when I heard that!
- Just for fun, who here uses Angular? React? Vue? Any other framework? [next]



### Another disclaimer while I'm at it

This is not a competition <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

So relax and get your kitty's claws back inside <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<img src="/img/kittyclaws.gif"> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->



## But wait!! 

Something is different this time! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

notes:
- Let's reckon a bit together.. Shall we? [next]



## IT'S RECKON TIME!



<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://svelte.dev" data-preload> -->
<div style="position: absolute; width: 50%; right: 0; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5), 0 5px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); color: #fff; padding: 20px; font-size: 30px; text-align: left;">
    <p>Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.</p>
</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

notes:
- Cybernetically enhanced what?? Idk about you.. But that's some hardcore shit right there!!!!
- I feel like we are gonna do some terminator type of AI stuffs!!
- So that look like some of their top 3 claims.. yeah yeah.. every framework nowadays have these type of thingies
- Oh a description! .. can you read this? [next]
- So Svelte is a JS Compilish type of Framework.. Interesting [next]



## Not convinced at all
```js
alert("Needz examples!!!!!!!"); 
``` 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->



<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://svelte.dev/examples" data-background-interactive data-preload> -->



## Enough fooling around

Let's build something! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

notes:
- What should we build in the amount of time left? [check time]
- And remember, you guys/gals have to help me out build it!



### Please keep it simple!
